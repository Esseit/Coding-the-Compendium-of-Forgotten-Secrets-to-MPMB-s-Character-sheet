/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
		The script featured here is an explanation of how to make your own custom addition to MPMB's D&D 5e Character Tools.
		To add your own content to the Character Sheet, use the syntax below and save it in a file. You can then import this file directly to the sheet using the "Import" button and "Import/Export" bookmark.
		There you can either import the file as a whole or just copy the text into a dialogue.

		-KEEP IN MIND-
		Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, either by importing consecutive files or pasting the scripts into the dialogue.
		It is recommended to enter the code in a freshly downloaded or reset sheet before adding any other information so that there won't be any conflicts.

		Subject:	Spell
		Effect:		This is the syntax for adding a new spell
		Sheet:		v12.999 (2017-11-29)

		Please note that there is no code here to update drop-down boxes because the rop-down boxes in the spell selection dialogues are generated automatically and will include any spells you add correctly

		If you are looking for a way to add a cantrip/spell to the drop-down boxes in the attack sections, then you will have to look at the WeaponsList syntax and add the cantrip/spell as a weapon (as well)
