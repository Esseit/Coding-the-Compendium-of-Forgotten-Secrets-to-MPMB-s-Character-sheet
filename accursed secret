/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
		The script featured here is an explanation of how to make your own custom addition to MPMB's D&D 5e Character Tools.
		To add your own content to the Character Sheet, use the syntax below and save it in a file. You can then import this file directly to the sheet using the "Import" button and "Import/Export" bookmark.
		There you can either import the file as a whole or just copy the text into a dialogue.

		-KEEP IN MIND-
		Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, either by importing consecutive files or pasting the scripts into the dialogue.
		It is recommended to enter the code in a freshly downloaded or reset sheet before adding any other information so that there won't be any conflicts.

		Effect:		This is the syntax for adding a new spell
		Sheet:		v12.999 (2017-11-29)

		Please note that there is no code here to update drop-down boxes because the rop-down boxes in the spell selection dialogues are generated automatically and will include any spells you add correctly

		If you are looking for a way to add a cantrip/spell to the drop-down boxes in the attack sections, then you will have to look at the WeaponsList syntax and add the cantrip/spell as a weapon (as well)

  darkest planes. You instantly replicate the effects of a spell of\
  1st level from the sorcerer spell list, or a cantrip from any\
  spell list. Each time you cast this spell, roll a d20. If the result\
  is a 1 or lower, you are struck by an unholy force, and are\
  reduced to 0 hit points and fail your first and second death\
  saving throws immediately after the spell is cast. If you are\
  struck down a second time due to this spell before you finish\
  a long rest, you die and cannot be resurrected by a spell cast\
  using a spell slot lower than 8th level." + "\n   " + " At Higher Levels When you cast this spell using a spell\
  slot of 3rd level, you can replicate a spell of 2nd level or lower,\
  and the threshold for being struck increases to a result of 2\
  or lower. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th\
  level, you can replicate a spell of 3nd level or lower, and the\
  threshold for being struck increases to a result of 3 or lower.\
  This pattern continues until the spell is cast using a slot of\
  7th or higher level, where no additional effect is gained and\
  the threshold is not increased.",
